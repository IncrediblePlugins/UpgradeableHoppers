If you're using MySQL, please review the config after updating. Some values in the MySQL section have changed and need
to be configured if you're using MySQL. Otherwise, your hoppers won't load. So make sure to edit the section after updating and then restart the server immediately.
Especially "table-prefix" might require you to add an underscore ("_") at the end, if your current table names use underscores.

  mysql:
    # Enable this to use MySQL instead of "file based"
    # SQLite. For performance improvement it's recommended to
    # use MySQL. If you don't have access to a MySQL server,
    # just let this disabled (false).
    enabled: false
    address: 'localhost'
    port: '3306'
    database: 'upgradeablehoppers'
    username: 'minecraft'
    password: 'password'
    # It is highly recommended to set a unique table prefix if the plugin shares a database with other plugins.
    table-prefix: 'hoppers_'
